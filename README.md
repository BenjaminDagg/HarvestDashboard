## Install Dependencies

You will need to install Node.js and NPM/Yarn. To make it easier to manage Node.js installation versions, it is recommended to use the Node Version Manager (NVM). 

### NVM Installation
You can learn how to install NVM from their [README][nvm-github-readme]. NPM should come installed with any version of Node.js installed through NVM. 

### Yarn Installation
The installation instructions for Yarn are [here][yarn-install-docs].


```sh
$ yarn
```

## Start Application

```sh
 $ yarn run start
```

 The application will be running on http://localhost:3000
